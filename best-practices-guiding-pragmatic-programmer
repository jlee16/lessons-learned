Ask the pragmatic programmer to constantly test and re-test their software
Exceed the users' expectations and yet stay in tune with what users want
Make sure the pragmatic programmer is using blackboards to coordinate the diverse workflows
Elaborate a very exhaustive contract to make sure the pragmatic programmer knows exactly what it is he/she has to accomplish and what the incentives are
Ensure they keep the big picture in mind -- it is sometimes very easy to get caught in the intricacies of programming without remembering what it is we are trying to accomplish
