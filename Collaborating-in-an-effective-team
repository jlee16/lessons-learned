Given that a team made up of pragmatic programmers and project leaders is heavily dependent on each member's contribution and
collaboration, it is important to understand how to not just guide a pragmatic programmer but also how to collaborate as a
fellow team member in order to establish efficient, pragmatic team as a whole.

(1) Ubiquitous automation:
Having an integrated development environment where as many administrative items are automated is crucial in establishing the
baseline for the efficiency.  Automation can range from documentation, testing, and design, where results are automatically
generated and sent to relevant parties for quick facilitation and progress.

(2) Choosing moments and styles:
Each person will be dealing with different professional and personal matters at any given point in time.  It is therefore
crucial to establish high-level understanding of different communication styles and important key facts in order to minimize
unnecessary conflict to interfere with the progress and ultimately achieving the team's goals.  The rule of "knowing your
audience" (referring to customers) apply internally as well in order to have the right team dynamics and to collaborate
successfully.

(3) Pride vs. ego:
Confidence and high expectations are positive.  Confusing pride and ego however is negative personally and detrimental to the
group as a whole.  No one is deemed better than another in having an efficient, pragmatic, and ultimately successful team, and
ego can prejudice your performance.  Open communication and dialogue will help in keeping all team members on the same page.
